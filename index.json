The formal study of calculus started from the 17th century by well-known scientists and mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Calculus is a mathematical discipline that is primarily concerned with functions, limits, derivatives, integrals and infinite series. The emphasis is understanding concepts. The most fundamental concept in calculus is limit.\n   The Precise Definition of a Limit Let $ f(x) $ be a function defined on some open interval that contains $ a $, except possibly at $ a $ itself. Then we say that the limit of $ f(x) $ as $ a $ approaches $ a $ is $ L $, and we write $$ \\underset{x\\rightarrow a}\\lim f(x)=L $$ if for every number $ ϵ \u0026gt; 0 $ there is a number $ δ \u0026gt; 0 $ such that $$ \\text{if}\\quad 0\u0026lt;|x-a|\u0026lt;\\delta\\quad\\text{then}\\quad|f(x)-L|\u0026lt;\\epsilon $$\n   Continuity Let $ f $ be a function and let $ a\\in\\mathbb{R} $. The function $ f $ is said to be continuous at the point $ a $ if the following three things are true:\n $ f (a) $ is defined (that is, $ a $ is in the domain of $ f $.) The limit $ \\underset{x\\rightarrow a}\\lim f(x) $ exists. $ \\underset{x\\rightarrow a}\\lim f(x)=f(a) $   Derivative The derivative of a function $ f $ at a number $ a $, denoted by $ f\u0026rsquo;(a) $, is $$ f\u0026rsquo;(a)=\\underset{h\\rightarrow 0}\\lim\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} $$ if this limit exists.\nMIT Mathematics  Calculus is the study of how things change. It provides a framework for modeling systems in which there is change, and a way to deduce the predictions of such models.\n  Calculus is an exciting subject, justly considered to be one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect.

These structures which are critical for better understanding of the geodynamics and evolution of the deep Earth, need to be further resolved by high-resolution imaging techniques. The spectral-element method (SEM) can be used to accurately simulate seismic wave propagation in heterogeneous Earth models, and its application in full-waveform inversion (FWI) provides a promising high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging technique. But it can be computationally prohibitive when used to model small scale structures in the deep Earth based upon high-frequency seismic waves. The heavy computational cost can be circumvented by using hybrid methods, which restrict the main computation by SEM solver to only a small target region (e.g. above the CMB) encompassing possible 2-D/3-D anomalies, and apply efficient analytical or numerical methods to calculate the wavefield for 1-D background models. These forward modelling tools based on hybrid methods can be then used in the so-called ‘box tomography’ approach to resolve fine-structures in the deep Earth.\nIn this study, we outline the theory of a hybrid method used to model small scale structures in the deep Earth and present its implementation based on SEM solvers in a three-step workflow. First, the wavefield generated by the source is computed for the 1-D background model with traction and velocity saved for the virtual boundary of the target region, which are then used as boundary inputs to simulate the wavefield in the target region based on absorbing boundary condition in SEM. In the final step, the total wavefield at receivers is reconstructed based upon the total wavefield on the virtual boundary computed in the previous step. As a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the workflow of the hybrid method based on a 2-D SEM solver.

The average of all the updated velocity models is considered to be the input model of the next iteration. Different grids should partially/fully shift from each other and/or have different grid spacings to form the multiple-grid model parametrization. The efficacy of the multiple-grid model parametrization is demonstrated through the practical example of imaging the P-wave velocity structure along the San Jacinto fault, which is one of the most seismically active faults in California. A series of synthetic recovery examples shows that the multiple-grid model parametrization generally has a better or comparable performance in capturing the heterogeneous subsurface structures than a collocated grid. The root mean square values of the traveltime residuals in the final tomographic models obtained with the multiple-grid model parametrization are smaller than those with collocated grids. Tomographic results reveal strong heterogeneities in the crust along the San Jacinto fault. Significant velocity contrasts are observable across the fault at shallow depths. A low-velocity anomaly dominates the trifurcation area of the San Jacinto fault from the middle crust to the lower crust. Relatively large earthquakes occurred at the boundaries of low-velocity structures but with high-velocity anomalies nearby.

The main contribution of this paper consists of three aspects: (1) We derive the FGA formulation for the 3-D elastic wave equation. Rather than standard ray-based methods (e.g. geometric optics and Gaussian beam method), the derivation requires to do asymptotic expansion in the week sense (integral form) so that one is able to perform integration by parts.

In particular, we obtain the diabatic coupling terms for SH and SV waves, with the form closely connecting to the concept of Berry phase that is intensively studied in quantum mechanics and topology (Chern number). The accuracy and parallelizability of the FGA algorithm is illustrated by comparing to the spectral element method for 3-D elastic wave equation in homogeneous media.

We introduce the averaged medium scheme into the TSOS method to further increase its capability of dealing with heterogeneous media and match the boundary-modified scheme for implementing free-surface boundary conditions and the auxiliary differential equation complex frequency-shifted perfectly matched layer (ADE CFS-PML) non-reflecting boundaries with the TSOS method.

First, a linear relationship between the travel-time residual $ Δt = T^{obs}–T^{syn} $ and the relative velocity perturbation $ δc(x)/c(x) $ connected by a finite-frequency travel-time sensitivity kernel $ K(x) $ is theoretically derived using the adjoint method. To accurately calculate the travel-time residual $ Δt $, two automatic arrival-time picking techniques including the envelop energy ratio method and the combined ray and cross-correlation method are then developed to compute the arrival times Tsyn for synthetic seismograms. The arrival times $ T^{obs} $ of observed seismograms are usually determined by manual hand picking in real applications. Travel-time sensitivity kernel $ K(x) $ is constructed by convolving a~forward wavefield $ u(t,x) $ with an adjoint wavefield $ q(t,x) $. The calculations of synthetic seismograms and sensitivity kernels rely on forward modeling. To make it computationally feasible for tomographic problems involving a large number of seismic records, the forward problem is solved in the two-dimensional (2-D) vertical plane passing through the source and the receiver by a high-order central difference method. The final model is parameterized on 3-D regular grid (inversion) nodes with variable spacings, while model values on each 2-D forward modeling node are linearly interpolated by the values at its eight surrounding 3-D inversion grid nodes. Finally, the tomographic inverse problem is formulated as a regularized optimization problem, which can be iteratively solved by either the LSQR solver or a~nonlinear conjugate-gradient method. To provide some insights into future 3-D tomographic inversions, Fréchet kernels for different seismic phases are also demonstrated in this study.","tags":[""],"title":"Wave-equation-based travel-time seismic tomography – Part 1: Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ping Tong","Dimitri Komatitsch","Tai‐Lin Tseng","Shu‐Huei Hung","Chin‐Wu Chen","Piero Basini","Qinya Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1413072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1413072000,"objectID":"b6833a36d255fb04db4920a5dcf12b36","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2014-grl-tong/","publishdate":"2014-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2014-grl-tong/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a three‐dimensional (3‐D) hybrid method that interfaces the spectral‐element method (SEM) with the frequency‐wave number (FK) technique to model the propagation of teleseismic plane waves beneath seismic arrays.

We develop a hybrid method that interfaces a frequency–wavenumber (FK) calculation, which provides analytical solutions to 1-D layered background models with a spectral-element (SEM) numerical solver to calculate synthetic responses of local media to plane-wave incidence.This hybrid method accurately deals with local heterogeneities and discontinuity undulations, and represents an efficient tool for the forward modelling of teleseismic coda (including converted and scattered) waves. We benchmark the accuracy of the SEM-FK hybrid method against FK solutions for 1-D media. We then compute sensitivity kernels for teleseismic coda waves by interacting the forward teleseismic waves with an adjoint wavefield, produced by injecting coda waves as adjoint sources, based on adjoint techniques. These sensitivity kernels provide the basis for mapping variations in subsurface discontinuities, density and velocity structures through non-linear conjugate-gradient methods. We illustrate various synthetic imaging experiments, including discontinuity characterization, volumetric structural inversion for the crust or subduction zones. These tests show that using pre-conditioners based upon the scaled product of sensitivity kernels for different phases, combining finite-frequency traveltime and waveform inversion, and/or adopting hierarchical inversions from long- to short-period waveforms could reduce the non-linearity of the seismic inverse problem and speed up its convergence. The encouraging results of these synthetic examples suggest that inversion of teleseismic coda phases based on the SEM-FK hybrid method and adjoint techniques is a promising tool for structural imaging beneath dense seismic arrays.","tags":[""],"title":"High-resolution seismic array imaging based on an SEM-FK hybrid method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoxiao Li","Dinghui Yang","Ping Tong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1381449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1381449600,"objectID":"381cf84bbf2c0ac071983aaee361c909","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2012-sces-li/","publishdate":"2013-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2012-sces-li/","section":"publication","summary":"The optimal nearly-analytic discrete (ONAD) method is a new numerical method developed in recent years for solving the wave equation.

The two‐step STEM has a higher‐order accuracy in space than conventional finite‐difference (FD) methods when the same number of spatial grid points in a wavelength is used. For example, the stereo‐modeling method that uses five points in one spatial direction can achieve an eighth‐order accuracy in space, whereas other FD methods such as conventional FD methods, Lax–Wendroff correction (LWC) methods, and other methods only have a fourth‐order accuracy. Theoretical properties of the two‐step STEM including stability and errors are analyzed for 1D and 2D cases. The numerical dispersion relationship provided by the two‐step STEM for 1D and 2D cases are also investigated in this study. Meanwhile, we present numerical results computed by the two‐step STEM and compare with the eighth‐order LWC method, the eighth‐order staggered‐grid FD method, and the fourth‐order staggered‐grid method. Numerical results show that the two‐step STEM can effectively suppress numerical dispersion caused by discretizing the wave equations when coarse spatial grids are used or models have strong velocity contrasts between adjacent layers. In contrast to other high‐order FD methods such as the eighth‐order LWC, the eighth‐order staggered‐grid FD, and the fourth‐order staggered‐grid method, the new method has substantially less computational time and requires less memory because large spatial and time increments can be used.

The Iwaki earthquake and its aftershocks mainly occurred in a boundary zone with strong variations in seismic velocity and Poisson's ratio. Prominent low-velocity and high Poisson's ratio zones are revealed under the Iwaki source area and the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which may reflect fluids released from the dehydration of the subducting Pacific slab under Northeast Japan. The 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) caused static stress transfer in the overriding Okhotsk plate, resulting in the seismicity in the Iwaki source area that significantly increased immediately following the Tohoku-oki mainshock. Our results suggest that the Iwaki earthquake was triggered by the ascending fluids from the Pacific slab dehydration and the stress variation induced by the Tohoku-oki mainshock.

The NAID method is an alternative numerical modeling method for generating synthetic seismograms. The acoustic wave equation is first transformed into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to time variable t, and then directly integrated at a small time interval of [tn, tn+1] to obtain semi-discrete ordinary differential equations. The integral kernel is expanded into a truncated Taylor series, to which the integration operator is explicitly applied. The high-order temporal derivatives involved in the integral kernel are replaced by high-order spatial derivatives, which then are approximately calculated as a weighted linear combination of the displacement, the particle-velocity, and their spatial gradients. In this article, we investigate the theoretical properties of the revised NAID method, including the discrete error and the stability criteria. Numerical results for constant and layered velocity models show that, comparing to the Lax–Wendroff correction (LWC) scheme and the staggered-grid finite difference method, the NAID method can effectively suppress the numerical dispersion and source-noises caused by the discretization of the acoustic wave equation with too-coarse spatial grids or when models have strong velocity contrasts between adjacent layers. The proposed NAID method has been applied in computing the acoustic wavefields for two heterogeneous models – the corner edge model and the Marmousi model. Promising numerical results illustrate that the NAID method provides an encouraging tool for large-scale and complex wave simulation and inversion problems based on the acoustic equation.","tags":[""],"title":"High accuracy wave simulation – Revised derivation, numerical analysis and testing of a nearly analytic integration discrete method for solving acoustic wave equation","type":"publication"}]
